## color-palette-react

This Project was created using create-react-app. This web application allows users to create color palettes as well delete them. The application contains a preset of color palettes. Each color palette must have a unique name as well as unique colors within the palette. Each palette will have a name and emoji to identify them.  Once a palette is created it will be saved to local storage. After creating a palette, users will be able to view them in the home page. On the home page users can click any of the color palettes to view them. Once viewing a color palette the user can toggle between hex, rgb, and rgba code. The user can then copy any of the colors in that format. The user can also use to slider in the top nav bar to adjust color brightness within all colors or click more on any of the colors to view all shades of that color available.
